# Servizo

**This project was done by group of students as part of software engineering exam**

## About
**Servizo** is a full-cycle ordering and payments platform for bars, cafés and restaurants. Customers scan a unique QR code at the table to browse the live menu, place orders and pay—individually or as a group—without waiting for staff (paying by card). Owners manage the entire operation from an admin view, while waiters and bartenders see exactly what to prepare and serve.
